# üî¨ Advanced Rational Equation Solver Backend Integration

This document explains how to use the new backend rational equation solver that has been integrated into your MathVerse application.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend Server

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd math-cosmos-tutor-main

# Start the backend server
python start_backend.py
```

The backend will automatically:
- Check for required dependencies (Flask, Flask-CORS, SymPy, NumPy)
- Install missing packages if needed
- Start the server on `http://localhost:5000`

### 2. Start the Frontend

In a new terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd math-cosmos-tutor-main

# Install frontend dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üîß Backend Features

### API Endpoints

1. **POST /api/solve** - Solve rational equations with step-by-step explanations
2. **POST /api/validate** - Validate equation format and type
3. **POST /api/classify** - Classify equation type and characteristics
4. **GET /api/health** - Health check endpoint

### Example Usage

#### Solve an Equation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/solve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"equation": "1/(x-2) = 3/(x+1)"}'
```

#### Validate an Equation
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"equation": "1/(x-2) = 3/(x+1)"}'
```

## üéØ Frontend Integration

### New Solver Component

A new React component `RationalEquationSolver` has been created at:
```
src/components/calculator/RationalEquationSolver.tsx
```

### Accessing the Solver

1. **Via URL**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/solver`
2. **Via Homepage**: Click "Try New Solver" button on the homepage

### Features

- **Equation Input**: Enter rational equations using standard mathematical notation
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate equations before solving
- **Step-by-step Solutions**: Detailed explanations for each step
- **Equation Classification**: Automatic detection of equation type and characteristics
- **Teacher-level Insights**: Professional mathematical guidance

## üìù Supported Equation Formats

### Examples

```
1/(x-2) = 3/(x+1)
(x+1)/(x-3) = 2
x/(x+1) + 1/(x-1) = 2
(x^2 + 1)/(x-1) = x + 2
```

### Input Rules

- Use `x` as the variable (case-insensitive)
- Use `/` for division
- Use `^` for exponents
- Use standard mathematical notation
- Equations must contain `=` sign

## üîç Backend Solver Capabilities

### Mathematical Features

1. **Equation Validation**
   - Checks for valid rational equation format
   - Identifies forbidden functions (sin, cos, sqrt, etc.)
   - Validates equation structure

2. **Step-by-step Solutions**
   - Finds and factors denominators
   - Calculates Least Common Denominator (LCD)
   - Solves resulting polynomial equations
   - Checks for extraneous solutions
   - Provides teacher-level explanations

3. **Equation Classification**
   - Identifies equation type (linear, quadratic, rational, etc.)
   - Determines degree and characteristics
   - Detects missing terms
   - Analyzes factorability

### Advanced Features

- **Extraneous Solution Detection**: Automatically identifies and explains extraneous solutions
- **Restriction Analysis**: Finds values that make denominators zero
- **Teacher Voice**: Provides explanations in natural language
- **Mathematical Precision**: Uses SymPy for exact mathematical computations

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Connection Error**
   - Ensure the backend server is running on port 5000
   - Check if the solver file exists in the `api` directory
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

2. **Import Errors**
   - Run `pip install -r api/requirements.txt`
   - Ensure Python 3.7+ is being used

3. **Equation Not Recognized**
   - Check equation format (use `/` for division, not `√∑`)
   - Ensure equation contains `=` sign
   - Use `x` as the variable

### Debug Mode

To run the backend in debug mode:

```bash
cd math-cosmos-tutor-main/api
python solver.py
```

This will show detailed error messages and stack traces.

## üìö API Response Format

### Successful Solve Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "equation": "1/(x-2) = 3/(x+1)",
  "solution": "Step-by-step solution text...",
  "classification": {
    "type": "rational",
    "degree": null,
    "characteristics": {
      "has_rational_terms": true,
      "missing_terms": [],
      "is_factorable": false
    }
  },
  "valid": true,
  "message": "Valid rational equation"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing the issue"
}
```
